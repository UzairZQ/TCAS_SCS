# ‚úàÔ∏è TCAS (Traffic Collision Avoidance System) ‚Äì MATLAB Simulation

## üéØ Objective

This project simulates a **Traffic Collision Avoidance System (TCAS)** in MATLAB. TCAS is an airborne system designed to reduce the risk of mid-air collisions between aircraft by tracking nearby aircraft and issuing Resolution Advisories (RAs) when necessary.

The simulation is part of the **Safety-Critical Systems** course in the **MSc High Integrity Systems** program at **Frankfurt University of Applied Sciences**.

## üß† Project Description

This simulation models a basic TCAS system with the following functionalities:
- Simulates aircraft movement in 2D/3D space.
- Detects proximity-based conflicts between aircraft.
- Generates vertical Resolution Advisories (e.g., Climb, Descend).
- Visualizes aircraft positions and TCAS actions in MATLAB.
- Aligns with **SWEBOK** software engineering principles.
- Follows the **V-Model** development process for safety-critical systems.
